Pathways Â» NAMB is a cooperative pathway facilitated by the [Center for Great Commission Studies](https://thecgcs.org) at [Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary](https://sebts.edu) in partnership with the [North American Mission Board (NAMB)](https://www.namb.net/).  We hope to streamline the process of onboarding new church planters and simplify the application process for those wanting to go. NAMB has worked hard with the Center for Great Commission Studies to create a process that both meets their requirements and allows us the freedom to design a system that meets the unique needs of our churches.
