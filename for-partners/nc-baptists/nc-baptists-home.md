Pathways Â» NC Baptists is a cooperative equipping cohort facilitated by the [Center for Great Commission Studies](https://thecgcs.org) at [Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary](https://sebts.edu) in partnership with NC Baptsits.  We hope to streamline the process of onboarding new church planters and simplify the application process for those wanting to go. NC Baptists is working hard with the CGCS to create a process that both meets their requirements and allows us the freedom to design a system that meets the unique needs of churches.
