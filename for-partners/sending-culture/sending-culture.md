Do you want your church to send to the nations? Does this goal feel unattainable at times? How do we help develop and equip our congregations to live sent lives in our towns and across the world? If you are asking these questions, then this resource is for you! In this resource, we will present material, additional resources, and case studies of current churches that are developing sending cultures and have a pathway for sending to the nations. This resource will walk you through the steps to take as you seek to send people to the nations. You can utilize this page as a hub for the rest of the resource!

## Initial Stage - Discovery

Goal: For your congregation to **discover** God's call upon all believers to make disciples and to show the great need for the Gospel around the world.

### Culture

#### How do we begin to change the culture of our church?

Rome was not built in a day, and you cannot change the culture of your church overnight. This attitude and way of thinking have been ingrained in your community for years. Habits die hard, and worldviews are difficult to change. To effectively change a culture, you have to DRIP small changes that put missions and the need for spreading the Gospel in front of your people. As a leader, YOU must make missions and reaching the unreached with the Gospel a priority. Your congregations will not be captivated by missions until you yourself are captivated with a heart for the lost. Begin praying right now that the Lord will work in your heart. Pray that He will capture you with a heart for the lost, especially the unreached. Pray that He will give you wisdom to display His heart for the nations in your flock.

### Drip

#### What are some practical changes we can make to drip missions and sending into our atmosphere?

What do we mean by drip? A drip is something small that, if captured, swells over time. Think about a leaky faucet. Even if it is a small drip, over the course of a month, this small drip can cost you major dollars if it is consistent. This is what we want to do with our congregations. Consistently drip missions and sending. This will help it become a part of the culture. This needs to be both top-down and bottom-up. Do this from the pulpit and in your discipleship and evangelism.

1. Begin praying for missionaries and unreached peoples. This can be during your service, during prayer meetings, in discipleship, or in other people's homes.

3. Tell missionary stories as illustrations in your sermons. These can come from biographies or from current missionaries that you know.
4. Allow missionaries that you have sent or that your congregation knows of to send in videos and testimonies about how God is working around the world.
5. Use statistics about the lost and where they are as examples to grip the hearts of your congregation.

6. Have commissioning time when sending out short-term teams or trips.
7. Take short-term trips if this has not begun.
8. Have a section in your bulletin dedicated to the nations.
9. If you send out a monthly/quarterly update, highlight a testimony or unreached people group.
10. Some churches have adopted the mantra "you are sent" at the end of service to indicate to people that their commitment as an ambassador and witness does not stop within the walls of the church.
11. **Start going yourself.** Do evangelism in your local area and seek to display a heart for the nations by going to do ministry around the globe.
12. Create a discipleship plan that focuses on raising up laborers that see the heart of God for the lost.
13. Hold a local outreach day where members of the congregation can get involved in local ministry/missions.
14. Create cohorts where like-minded individuals can grow and be equipped.

### Goal

#### What is the desired outcome of creating a sending culture?

The desired outcome of creating a sending culture is to see the Lord raise up more laborers to go into the harvest (Matthew 9:35-38, Luke 10:2). The Gospels tell us the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. We are to pray that the Lord will raise up laborers to go to the nations. This is our responsibility as believers. We are called to make disciples (Matthew 28:18-20), to be witnesses to the Gospel (Acts 1:8), and to be ambassadors for Christ (2 Corinthians 5:18-21). We are to share near and far, from Judea to Samaria to the ends of the earth, that all nations might worship the Lord as a great multitude that no one can count, from every nation, tribe, people, and language (Revelation 7:9). Furthermore, we should desire to see members of our congregation rallied for the cause of Christ and discipled in a way that takes the Gospel to the nations. And not only this, we should desire to see everyone in our congregation live in a way that others know we are followers of Jesus.

### Objections

#### What are common objections?

"My church cannot send because we are too small. My church cannot send because we do not have enough money. My church cannot send because we do not have enough time. My church cannot send because we are too old. My church cannot send because there are too many young children."

The objections above are quite common today. Many churches feel the need to improve their own lot before going to the nations. If we think about our own conversion and testimony, Jesus does not expect us to be perfect or to fix ourselves before coming to Him. He invites all those who are weary, heavy-laden, and sinful to turn to Him in repentance and belief. It is the same thing here. God wants to use all believers as ambassadors and witnesses to the nations. God's heart is for the nations to know the love of Jesus and to worship the one true God. He chooses to use believers to spread the Gospel (2 Corinthians 5:10-21, Romans 10:13-15).

Whatever your objection, we need to stop saying no and think deeply about how the Bible calls us to go and make disciples. The Bible says that all nations are to be reached with the Gospel. Jesus came to seek and save the lost. We need to model our lives after Jesus and seek to go to the lost nations of the globe.

### Church Size

#### How large does my church congregation need to be to pull this off?

To start dripping missions, your church does not have to be a specific size. You can do many of these tasks with any size congregation and in any service. I recognize that changing the order of service or the amount of time you spend in service may be taboo to some. Thus, you can start small. Add an unreached people group to the prayer list. Add a missionary you know to the prayer list. Ask your congregation to pray for these requests.

At some point, the issue of size and money may come up, especially when thinking about taking short-term trips, supporting missionaries, or equipping missionaries. Do not worry. You are not alone. One idea is to link arms with other churches that are in similar stations and send a missionary together. Cooperate and jointly do the work! In this way, churches of all sizes and ages can participate in the sending process!

Stephen Witmer, in his article, [*How A Small Church Can Be a Sending Church*](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/small-church-sending/){:target="_blank"}, puts it this way: "Let’s be honest, small churches. If we’re not as fruitful in global missions as we could be, it’s not because our numbers are too small. It’s because our passion for the global glory of Christ is too small. Our concern for those who die apart from him is too small. Our willingness to be inconvenienced and to give sacrificially is too small."[^1] We must be willing to put it all on the line for the sake of King Jesus!

## Second Stage - Development

Goal: For you to **identify** members of your congregation and then **equip** them to go to the nations.

---

### Identification

#### How do we identify members of our congregation who could be fit for sending?

What does a potential missionary look like? Is there a cookie cutter outline? Are there qualities that every missionary has? Are there qualities that every missionary needs? Have these qualities already appeared, or do we help to cultivate them? How much time and effort will this take? These questions and more arise when we think about identifying members of our congregation that could be fit for sending. These questions may seem insurmountable. Yet, the Bible gives us many examples of local congregations raising up laborers to be sent out. The first example that comes to mind is Acts 13, where the church in Antioch sets aside Paul and Barnabas under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Then, in the rest of Acts, we see Paul encouraging local churches to raise up laborers to do this kind of ministry also (Timothy, Apollos, and others in Paul's band). Romans 10 also puts pressure on us as believers. How can people hear if there are no people bringing the Gospel to them? This mandate is for the church. The church is called by God to be a kingdom outpost that raises up laborers to go with the Gospel. Thus, identification is an important role played by the church.

Keelan Cook has written an article about this titled [*Identifying to Send: Examine These Three Areas in a Person's Life*](https://keelancook.com/2020/03/23/identifying-to-send/){:target="_blank"}. This article lists out the 3 C's for identification: Character, Calling, and Competency. In this article, Keelan delineates how churches can identify potential missionaries and help them begin a journey of going. Take a look at this article to see how you can begin identifying members of your congregation today!

### Equipping

#### How do we equip our members who have been called or who we have identified?

Equipping can seem like a giant task for pastors. Some might think that they have no additional space to equip laborers to be missionaries when they are dealing with weddings, funerals, and the everyday rhythms of ministry. Yet, God has called the church to equip laborers in many ways that the nations might be reached with the Gospel. Today, there are many ways this can be done. Members of our congregations can go to seminaries, Bible colleges, and more. Yet, it is also important that this be a partnership and that local churches get involved in this process.

As a sequel to his above article, Keelan Cook has written, [*How One Church Prepares its Missionaries Before they Go*](https://keelancook.com/2016/02/03/how-one-church-prepares-its-missionaries-before-they-go/){:target="_blank"}. This article builds on the idea of identification to then help equip those whom you have identified. This is just one example for how a church might do this. Check out the case studies below for how other churches have helped equip their members to be missionaries!

We also have some introductory material made available for cohorts. Cohorts are groups formed around a similar calling for the purpose of training and equipping. Check out the links below to see how you might be able to implement a cohort into your equipping process.

Another great resource is hosted at Southeastern in the Distance Learning Office. Southeastern has a new program titled [**EQUIP**](https://www.sebts.edu/academics/the-equip-network/){:target="_blank"} which discusses how local churches can be more involved in their members theological education. Feel free to reach out to the Distance Learning office to see how your church might be able to participate today!

The Sent Life Podcast recently released a podcast about the crucial role of the church in developing missionaries. You can find that podcast [here.](https://www.thecgcs.org/resources/podcast/the-crucial-role-of-the-church-in-developing-missionaries/){:target="_blank"}

Many missions organizations have requirements for a missionary before they are sent. I would advise you to look into some of these requirements and see if you can put some of them into your discipleship process. This would make it easier for your congregation to complete the application process for missions organizations. One church has done this with the IMB, calling it "Creating Your IMB Portfolio." Even if the member of the congregation does not go with the IMB, they have utilized some of the documentation required as a way to help equip the members of their congregation. It was once said that what your members are not doing in the US, they will not do overseas. Thus, in your equipping, you want to target training toward what they will be doing on the field and expect that of your members while they are at home. The IMB requires an applicant to fill out a witnessing journal that displays evangelistic conversations before going to the field. This is an easy way to get your members ready to go! If you have questions about this, feel free to reach out to the CGCS or the IMB!

## Third Stage - Deployment

Goal: For you to **send** the members of your congregation to unreached places and then to **support** them while they are actively serving in this capacity.

---

### Sending

#### What does the sending process look like?

The sending process depends on the organization that the member of your congregation decides to go with to the field. Some missionaries go alone and are sent out by their church. Other missionaries are sent by their church through the IMB. Other missionaries are sent by their church through other organizations such as CRU, Reaching and Teaching, Baptists on Mission, Wycliffe, and more. Each organization has a different process for approval and sending. You do not have to know all these processes off the top of your head. However, if a member of your congregation decides to go with an organization, you should get to know more about what they do and how the local church can partner with them.

#### Who needs to be involved?

The head pastor, missions pastor (if applicable), the small group/Sunday school class, and the whole congregation should have some level of involvement in the sending process. Involving the church in the process of sending will help you drip missions to the congregation as a whole and show that going is not just for hyper-Christians but involves everyone. The extent to which people are involved may vary, but you want to ensure some sort of involvement by the entire church.

##### Pastoral Involvement

The head pastor and missions pastor will most likely take the point on sending, and many organizations require references and recommendations by local pastors before sending. If your church is large enough, you may have a missions team that is involved with this part of the process or a missions committee that can take on some of this burden. However, as pastors, the Lord has called you to shepherd the flock He has given to you, and those you are sending are a part of this flock. It is your duty to equip, train, and love them as they embark on this process. I heard it put this way recently: "Those we are sending are the beautiful feet in our congregation. Even when they are sent out, they are still a part of our body, and we must care for them in that way." Thus, pastors, those who are sent out by your church are still your sheep and a part of the flock. Caring for them might look different, but you are still to care well for them as they are sent. During the sending process, this may also involve prayer, fundraising support, and presenting members before the congregation to affirm the call that the Lord has placed on their lives.

##### Small Group/Sunday School Involvement

Sending involves more than just pastors. You can involve small groups and Sunday school classes as well. To do so, invite the small groups and Sunday school classes to pray weekly for the Lord to raise up laborers to go to the harvest. This also helps create a culture for sending and is a way to drip missions to your congregation. When you know of someone who is thinking about going or is in the process of applying, encourage that small group or Sunday school class to pray weekly for this family. If they are raising financial support, encourage that group to ask how they can be involved with this process. Encourage the leader of the small group to be involved with the family as they are getting ready to go overseas. They will still need community support when they are overseas and when they return.

##### Congregational Involvement

In order to reach more of your congregation with the idea of sending, you will want to put sending in front of the congregation as a whole. An easy way to do this is to commission teams to go out during your main worship service. By bringing them forward, praying over them, and inviting the congregation to pray for the team as well, you are putting missions front and center. You are showing those in your congregation that sending is important enough to be talked about on Sunday and should be a part of their lives. Often, those going on a mission trip will raise funds for their trip. This is another way to involve the congregation. Aid those going by encouraging your congregation to give toward these trips. In considering and praying over whether one should give to reach the nations, the congregation may be transformed. They will have to consider the cost of supporting trips and how the Lord wants them to utilize their finances.

### Supporting

Supporting and sending may seem similar. However, by supporting, we mean the time after the family unit has left to go overseas. How do you care for and support those who have been sent out of your church? What are the best ways to support overseas workers? Do you e-mail them? Visit them? Video chat with them? How frequently should we do this? Do we support those we have sent financially? How do I, as a pastor, view those members who have been sent out? This section deals with how we support those who have been sent out of our congregations!

#### How do we support those we have sent?
There are a myriad of ways to support those who have been sent. The first way is by partnering in prayer. Pray daily, weekly, or monthly for the missionaries you have sent. Invite your members to pray for those who have been sent on a regular basis as well. These can be general requests, such as endurance, strength, peace in transition, boldness, acceptance when they share the Gospel, and wisdom. You can also ask the missionaries for more specific requests. The missionaries may send out a monthly update. Be sure to receive this update, as it includes these specific requests. Further, you can reach out to the missionaries and ask for more specific requests. 

Second, you can partner with those who you have sent by reaching out to them around birthdays and holidays. On the field, those who you have sent are isolated, and any word of encouragement and remembrance around holidays is especially meaningful. 

Third, you can partner with those you have sent by visiting them on the field, whether that is a care trip or sending teams to partner with them in ministry on the ground. A care trip is focused on the spiritual health of the missionaries. Your team could watch their kids, giving the missionaries much-needed time together. You could fly them to a central location with other missionaries that you have sent and put on a time of worship and debriefing. You could just sit with them and give them a listening ear of understanding. A mission trip is focused on reaching the people in the country where the sent one is working. Allow the team on the ground to set the strategy and partner with them in their vision. This offers them substantial support and resources that they do not have other times in the year.

Overall, these are just a few ways to support those you have sent. Below are a few articles that talk about other ways to support those who have been sent.

#### How much is too much? How little is too little?

If you were to go to the field, how would you like the church to support you? Would you like to be sent out and never be contacted again? Would you like to be contacted every day? There are guardrails here on each side. No contact at all is too little. However, contact every day or even every week for those in secure locations can be pressing. A couple of suggestions include a touchpoint at least once a month, contact on birthdays and holidays (these may take the place of your once a month time), and visiting your sent ones at least once a term (a term is normally 3 years long). This may also be on a case-by-case basis. Talk with those you are sending to set appropriate expectations as they are sent. Know what you are able to do and what those who are sent expect you to do. Allow both of these ideas to set guidelines, and pray that the Lord will help you both know how to partner well!
