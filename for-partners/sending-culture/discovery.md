## Culture

### How do we begin to change the culture of our church?
Rome was not built in a day, and you cannot change the culture of your church over night. This attitude and way of thinking has been ingrained into your community for years. Habits die hard and worldviews are difficult to change. To effectively change a culture, you have to DRIP small changes that put missions and the need for spreading the Gospel in front of your people. As a leader, YOU must make missions and seeing the unreached reached with the Gospel a priority. Your congregations will not be captivated by missions until you yourself are captivated with a heart for the lost. Begin praying right now that the Lord would work in your heart. Pray that He would captive you with a heart for the lost, especially the unreached. Pray that He would give you wisdom to display His heart for the nations to your flock.

## Drip

### What are some practical changes we can make to drip missions and sending into our atmosphere?
What do we mean by drip? A drip is something small, that if captured, swells over time. Think about a leaky faucet. Even if it is a small drip, over the course of a month, this small drip can cost you major dollars if it is consistent. This is what we want to do with our congregations. Consistently drip missions and sending. This will help it to become a part of the culture. This needs to be both top down and bottom up. Do this from the pulpit and in your discipleship/evangelism.
1. Begin praying for missionaries and unreached peoples. This can be during your service, during prayer meetings, in discipleship, and in other people's homes.

3. Tell missionary stories as illustrations in your sermons.
4. Allow missionaries that you have sent or that your congregation knows of to send in videos and testimonies about how God is working around the world.
5. Use statistics about the lost as examples to grip the hearts of your congregation.
6. Have commissioning time when sending out short-term teams/trips.
7. Take short-term trips if this has not begun.
8. Have a section in your bulletin dedicated to the nations.
9. If you send out a monthly/quarterly update, highlight a testimony or unreached people group.
10. Some churches have adopted the mantra "you are sent" at the end of service to indicate to people that their commitment as an ambassador and witness does not stop within the walls of the church.
11. Start going yourself. Do evangelism in your local area and seek to display a heart for the nations by going to do ministry around the globe.
12. Create a discipleship plan that focuses on raising up laborers that see the heart of God for the lost.
13. Hold a local outreach day where members of the congregation can get involved in local ministry/missions.
14. Create cohorts where like-minded individuals can grow and be equipped.

## Goal 

### What is the desired outcome of creating a sending culture?
The desired outcome of creating a sending culture is to see the Lord raise up more laborers to go into the harvest (Matthew 9:35-38, Luke 10:2). The Gospels tell us the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. We are to pray that the Lord would raise up laborers to go to the nations. This is our responsibilities as believers. We are called to make disciples (Matthew 28:18-20), to be witnesses to the Gospel (Acts 1:8), and to be ambassadors for Christ (2 Corinthians 5:18-21). We are to share near and far, from Judea, to Samaria, to the ends of the earth, that all nations might worship the Lord as a great multitude that no one can count, from every nation, tribe, people and language (Revelation 7:9). We should desire to see members of our congregation rallied for the cause of Christ and discipled in a way that takes the Gospel to the nations. And not only this, we should desire to see everyone in our congregation live in a way that others know we are followers of Jesus.

## Objections

### What are common objections?
"My church cannot send because we are too small. My church cannot send because we do not have enough money. My church cannot send because we do not have enough time. My church cannot send because we are too old. My church cannot send because there are too many young children."

Whatever your objection, we need to stop saying no, and think deeply about how the Bible calls us to go and make disciples. The Bible says that all nations are to be reached with the Gospel. Jesus came to seek and to save the lost. We need to model our lives after Jesus and seek to go to the lost nations of the globe.

## Size

### How big does my church have to be to pull this off?
To start dripping missions, your church does not have to be a specific size. You can do many of these tasks with any size congregation and in any service. I recognize that changing the order of service or the amount of time you spend in service may be taboo to some. Thus, you can start small. Add an unreached people group to the prayer list. Add a missionary you know to the prayer list. Ask your congregation to pray for these requests.

At some point, the issue of size and money may come up, especially when thinking about taking short-term trips, supporting missionaries, or equipping missionaries. Do not worry. You are not alone. One idea is to link arms with other churches that are in similar stations and send a missionary together. Cooperate and jointly do the work! In this way, churches of all sizes and ages can participate in the sending process!
