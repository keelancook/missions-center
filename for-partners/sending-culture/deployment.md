## Goal
For you to **send** the members of your congregation to unreached places and then to **support** them while they are actively serving in this capacity.

## Sending

### What does the sending process look like?

### Who needs to be involved?

## Supporting

### How do we support those we have sent?

### How much is too much? How little is too little?
