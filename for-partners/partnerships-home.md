Welcome to the Denominational Partnerships home page! This space is a repository for our denominational partners. This page will hold information on how to cooperate together as Southern Baptists. This will be a resource for members of our denominational partners as we seek to fulfill the Great Commission together!

## Equipping Portal
In this section, we desire that the site itself become a tool for training both churches and potential sent ones from their churches. Our goal is to provide a central location for associations, churches, and individuals to point those they are equipping to walk through a training process.

This will not be the place where we advertise or promote the CGCS. You can find that information on [the main website](https://thecgcs.org/trips).

Feel free to check back on this page at a later date. If you would like to contact us directly, feel free to do so at [our main website](https://thecgcs.org/contact/).
