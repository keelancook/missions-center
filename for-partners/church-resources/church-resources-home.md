Welcome to the Church Resources home page! This space is a repository for churches and church leaders. Church leaders will find information about developing a sending culture, identifying and assessing people in their church for missions sending, and tools to equip those people for the sake of the Great Commission.

## Resource Hub
In this section, you will find a collection of materials for local churches looking to implement sending processes or assess their own calling. These materials include reading lists, potential equipping cohort materials, and explainers for developing a sending culture within a church. This resource hub is continually in development, and we hope to continue adding valuable tools as we develop them.

## Equipping Portal
In addition to a resource hub, we desire that the site itself will become a tool for training both churches and potential sent ones from their churches. Our goal is to provide a central location for associations, churches, and individuals to point those they are equipping to walk through a training process.

This will not be the place where we advertise or promote the CGCS. You can find that information on [the main website](https://thecgcs.org/trips).

Feel free to check back on this page at a later date. If you would like to contact us directly, feel free to do so at [our main website](https://thecgcs.org/contact/).
