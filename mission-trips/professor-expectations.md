# Professor Expectations

---

## Pre-Trip

---

### Before the Trip is Approved and Promoted

1. Research food costs, place of stay, local travel, and ministry expenses.
   * The CGCS will book (NOT RESEARCH) airfare and travel insurance. You are required to research travel before submitting the prospectus to give an accurate projection for the cost of travel. This includes submitting a potential flight path and pricing.
   * You also need to research medical availability and access while on the trip for the various locations you will be visiting.
   * You will need to calculate a food/expense estimate PER DAY for trip members.
   * You will need to include an estimate for ground transportation. 
     * This could include van rentals, daily public transportation expenses, ground transport to and from airport, etc.
   * You will need to include multiple options for place of stay. 
     * Our preference would be for you to go to places where housing is provided by the team on the ground.
     * This could either be group housing or discounted housing provided by local workers. You may also research AirBnBs or other group lodging.
     * A last option would be to stay in hotels, but this should be avoided as it is not the best stewardship of funds.
     * If a reasonable play of stay cannot be secured, the trip option will not work.
   * This also includes information about visas, immunizations, and the country's needs.
   * You also need to research **[medical availability](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/)** and access while on the trip for the various locations you will be visiting.
   * You also need to research the safety of the area you will be going. You can check some travel information at the **[U.S. State Department's website.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html)**
2. Be aware of local culture.
   * Develop a relationship with workers on the ground where the mission trip will be located, identifying needs and goals of current teams on the ground.
   * This might also necessitate conversation with locals to best determine the needs of the area.
3. Submit a mission trip prospectus form by the end of the Spring semester for the following academic year.

### After Trip is Approved and is Promoted

 1. Develop a course syllabus that goes along with the mission trip.
    * This includes 500 pages of reading (minimum), a 3-to-5-page reflection paper integrating the academic and personal aspects of trip, and a prayer journal.
    * You can find syllabus templates [here](/mission-center/mission-trips/syllabus-template.html/).
 2. Help promote the trip in your classes, on campus, and on social media.
 3. Host a mandatory briefing with students to discuss expectations and goals for the trip.
    * Students fail the course if they do not attend.
    * Develop a list of expectations for students. Some examples may include the expectations that the CGCS has set for you, while others may include expectations from personal experience.
    * Go over specific orientation details.
    * Get 1-2 prayer requests from each student and send to CGCS Communication Specialist.
 4. Select trip scholarship recipients. The Financial Aid Office has created a scholarship for students specifically going on mission trips. You, as the professor, will be in charge of choosing the student(s) who will receive the scholarship.
 5. Pray for the Lord to open the hearts and minds of the people you will be attempting to reach.
 6. **Keep track of receipts or any items purchased before the trip for the trip.**
 7. Display humility and expect humility from your students.
 8. **Make sure your passport is up to date.**
 9. Prepare spiritually as well as physically.
10. Pack well.

## During Trip

 1. Interact with students and engage in mentorship. We expect you to be a leader who is personal and approachable. We expect you to lead out in the areas where you expect students to participate.
    * Professors are not necessarily responsible for daily lectures on missions and evangelism. However, they are encouraged to provide teaching during the course as it relates to missions, evangelism, the particular context of the trip, contextualization, etc.
    * Facilitate a time of processing in the evening after the day of ministry is over.
 2. Encourage prayer in the lives of students.
 3. Facilitate time to be in the Word and abide with the Lord. Encourage students to do the same.
 4. Remind students of their prayer journals.
 5. Get to know each of the students on the trip. Do not just focus on that one stellar student who you know well.
 6. Integrate academics with application. Note to your students the areas of integration with reading, lecture, or assignments.
 7. Be clear in leadership.
 8. Engage and encourage partners on the ground. Do not make life more difficult for them. You are there to encourage and help them.
 9. Maintain student safety throughout the trip.
10. Maintain nationals' security if in a secure location.
11. Train students on how to do evangelism and engage with the people group you are focusing on reaching.

13. Partner with local workers and nationals in your ministry strategy.
14. Follow principles outlined in When Helping Hurts. Try not to leave local workers with unreal expectations to meet.

## Post-Trip

   * This should include a rough estimate of gospel conversations and/or ministry that occurred

   * Any difficulties or student issues
2. Take notes on what you need to do differently when leading a trip next year. Always be thinking about how to better serve as you lead mission trips.

5. Send to **CGCS Communication Specialist** a list of students who could share a story to promote mission trips in the future.
