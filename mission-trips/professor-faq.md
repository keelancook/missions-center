## General Information
 
 ---

### Where can I go on a mission trip? Is there anywhere out of bounds?
   * You are allowed to go anywhere in the world. Safety of our students is of utmost importance, so consider this as you are choosing where to go. You should also look to partner with workers on the ground where you are going. First choice would be to partner with IMB personnel. Places that are out of bounds might include war zones, places deemed unsafe by the IMB or other agencies, or secure locations that would put teams you visit at risk.

### Where have we gone on mission trips before?
   * We have gone to many countries in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and South America. We have also gone on trips to many locations in the North America such as Utah, Alaska, Florida, Houston, NYC, Toronto, Mexico, and Clarkston.

### What should we do on a mission trip?
   * The primary goal of a mission trip is to partner with workers on the field to do evangelism and outreach to a certain area. We want to expose our students to cross-cultural communication and evangelism while on these trips. We want to see the Gospel spread to the ends of the earth! This is our primary call and goal when going on a mission trip. This can be done through a myriad of ways: door-knocking, VBS, sports camps, open-air preaching, etc.

### Who should we be working with when going on a mission trip?
   * We highly advise you to work with IMB or NAMB workers who reside in your destination. These two organizations are our partners on the field who know the context and can best guide you to applicable ministry strategies. In doing so, you will also be aiding those workers who are on the field, potentially giving them needed aid and uplifting encouragement.

### Do we have to work with IMB or NAMB?
   * You do not have to work with IMB or NAMB contacts. If you are not going to be doing so, you must give a defense for why you are not working with these organizations. The defense must be given to the associate director or director of the CGCS and cleared with them.

### What is an appropriate length for a mission trip?
   * This depends on whether your mission trip is going to be over Spring Break, Fall Break, or Summer Break. Spring and Fall Break will limit you to a maximum amount of days before students have to return. Ideally, a trip will have at least 5 full days of in country "work." You are allowed to have a trip be longer if you so desire. The minimum expectation though is 5 days in country.

### How many students should I be taking on a mission trip?
   * You will be taking anywhere from 8 to 12 on a mission trip. This is an ideal size to be able to develop relationships with your students and not feel overwhelmed by too many. If you feel like you can take more, or if you have a second faculty going with you, please communicate this with us beforehand.

### Does a mission trip participant have to be a SEBTS student?
   * To go on a mission trip with SEBTS, the participant has to be a SEBTS student. Sometimes students ask if they can bring their spouses who are not SEBTS students. Most of the time, the answer to this question is no.

### Can I bring my spouse? Children? **NEED HELP** 
   * This depends on what housing you can find for the team. We do not want spouses or children taking up spots that would otherwise go to students. We also do not want family to take away from your ability to focus on students and invest in them.

### Can I lead a mission trip with another professor? **NEED HELP**
   * The short answer is yes.

### What strategies can we implement when going on a mission trip?
   * Our core strategy when going on a mission trip is to partner with local believers or local missionaries who work in the target area. We will partner with them, coming alongside their strategies and rhythms to get the Gospel to the nations. The IMB utilizes a strategic method called the Core Missionary Task (Entry, evangelism, discipleship, healthy church formation, leadership training, and partnership and exit). Partnering with IMB teams in one of these categories is a great way to implement strategy. Other strategies include aiding in-country churches with VBS, caring for in-country missionaries, diaspora work, replanting/revitalization work, and being involved in open-air preaching. The goal of our strategy should always be the fulfillment of the Great Commission. So, whatever strategy you choose to implement, it should have as its thrust, the Great Commission. **Want to discuss this with you. Feel like I should know these better than I do.**

### What expectations does the CGCS have of faculty members?
   * See professor expectation list **[by clicking here](/missions-center/mission-trips/professor-expectations.html)**. There are expectations before the trip, during the trip, and after the trip. Please read these carefully.

### Do professors share rooms with students?
   * Professors are advised against sharing a room with students. This can create questions that you may not want and the school does not want. Avoid this at all costs.

### What level do the students want to be involved on the trip?
   * At the moment, many students are going on a mission trip because it is a class requirement for their degree. Students at SEBTS want to be involved in ministry but they may not know how. Many students tend to reflect that mission trips are their first engagement with cross-cultural ministry and evangelism. As the leader, you may need to care well for students who go for the first time.

### How do we deal with conflict and complaining on a trip?
   * Conflict is inevitable, especially when formulating a team of students who may be experiencing a new culture for the first time. Dealing with conflict changes on a case-by-case basis. Before conflict arises, you should set an example as a leader who serves and does not complain. Meet with students who are causing issues one-on-one, inquiring about their concerns and negativity. Try to meet their needs while reminding them of the Gospel and the work they are there to do. You can also encourage your students who are leaders to take other students under their wing to help them grow in this area.

### How do you vet students for the trip?
   * Students who are interested in going submit an application on our website. At the moment, the students who complete our application first are given spots.

### What is the deal for injuries and medical assistance while we are in-country?
   * Medical assistance and care is up to you to find before going to your destination. You should know ahead of time where students who are injured can go and what is the best method for treatment. Local workers may know where injured students may go. Asking those in-country is a great idea. Plan ahead and ensure that all students know the health risk and bring needed medicines.

### How many students will there be per leader?
   * This is up to you as a professor. Ideally, 8 to 12 students is appropriate.

### Will I have access to an interpreter or will I need to arrange this if people cannot speak English? Should we even go to a location like this?
   * Arranging for an interpreter will be up to the professor. The CGCS will not arrange this for you. Going to a location that needs an interpreter is a possibility. This will depend on what strategies you are implementing while on the trip. If students are expected to do door-knocking or street evangelism where English is not spoken, you might want to rethink your strategy.

## Preparation Questions

--- 

### How do I suggest a mission trip to the CGCS?
   * To suggest a trip to the CGCS, you must submit a trip prospectus form. You may also reach out to our director, Keelan Cook, or our assistant director (hopefully). The trip prospectus form can be found **[by clicking here](https://cgcs.wufoo.com/forms/mx5d1q41tgaui9/)**.

### What are the requirements to lead a Southeastern mission trip?
   * **Need help**

### When is the mission trip prospectus due?
   * The mission trip prospectus is due at the end of the Spring Semester for the following school year (e.g. a summer 2025 trip would be due by the end of Spring 2024).

### How do I access the mission trip prospectus?
   * Again, the trip prospectus form can be found **[by clicking here](https://cgcs.wufoo.com/forms/mx5d1q41tgaui9/)**.

### Do we need to turn in a trip prospectus every year if we want to do the same trip again?
   * Yes a trip prospectus will be due every year. This is because cost estimates will fluctuate from year to year. This will help us get a better idea as we estimate total budget for mission trips.

### What classroom materials do I need to prepare for a mission trip?
   * Professors are not necessarily responsible for daily lectures on missions and evangelism. However, you are encouraged to provide teaching during the course as it relates to missions, evangelism, the particular context of the trip, contextualization, etc.
   * You also need to prepare a class syllabus. This includes required reading and assignments. 
   * Here is an **[example PDF syllabus](/missions-center/files/Mission%20Trip%20Syllabus%20Template.pdf)**. If you want a Word Document version **[click here](/missions-center/mission-trips/syllabus-template.html)**.

### Is there any help in reserving airfare/hotels/etc.? Or will I need to do this on my own?
   * The CGCS will book airfare and travel insurance for you. You will be responsible for arranging local transportation and housing, as well as schedule while on the ground.

### How long before a mission trip do I need to propose said trip? Six months? One year? Two years?
   * As mentioned above, you need to submit a mission trip on the prospectus form by the end of the Spring for the following academic year. This includes fall trips, winter trips, spring trips, and summer trips.

### Do we have to be able to get visas when entering the countries?
   * Some countries require visas before entering a country, while other countries allow you to get visas at the gate. You need to have researched this beforehand and know what it takes to get into the country you will be going to.

### As I begin planning a trip, what kind of things do I need to research?
   * You need to research local partnerships and culture. To adaquately do cross-cultural missions, you must know the area you are ministering in and the culture that you will be engaging with upon arrival.
      * You also need to research airfare, housing, food costs, local transportation, immunization needs, accessible healthcare in case of injury, and safety advisories. 
   * Costs associated will need to be submitted on the trip prospectus before a trip can be approved.

### Do I need to lead a devotional every morning for students? Or will students do this?
   * The students need to have some sort of personal time with the Lord. You can make this personal time a requirement and put this into your trip schedule. You can also choose to have group devotionals in the morning after this time, if you feel like you can fit that into your schedule. You can lead a devotional or have a student lead the short devotional. This is up to you. We encourage some group prayer time before going out for the day, seeking the Lord's guidance and aid in your endeavors.

### What guidelines do I need to follow in creating the trip?
   * The guidelines to follow in creating the trip are located in this FAQ section and the **[Trip Expectations](/missions-center/mission-trips/professor-expectations.html)**. You also need to follow SEBTS guidelines for course requirements.

> link to this, either the website or on the webpage below.

### What guidelines do I need to follow while on the trip?
   * During the trip, you will be representing yourselves, the Lord, and SEBTS. While on the field, you are to follow covenantal guidelines found in the BFM 2000, the Student Handbook, and any other documents that you are expected to uphold while serving as a professor. Just because you are out of the country does not mean your expectations change. They are the same as while you are on campus. An additional expectation on a mission trip is that you invest in the students on the trip, desiring to see them stretched in new ways and encouraging them to take steps of faith.

### What expectations do we have for students?
   * We expect students to be heavy participants on the trip. They should not be lackadaisical or apathetic. They are to be involved every step of the way. Students are also expected to complete all course related materials, attend a pre-trip briefing, and write a donor thank you letter. Other expectations can be found **[by clicking here](/missions-center/mission-trips/student-expectations.html)**.

## Money

### How much does it cost for me as a professor to go on a trip? Do I have to pay my own way?
