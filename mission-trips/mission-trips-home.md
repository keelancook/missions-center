We are currently developing a knowledge base and manual for mission trips through the [Center for Great Commission Studies](https://thecgcs.org). There is a lot of information and many frequensly asked questions, so we want a place online where students, faculty, and staff can find all of that infromation. 

This will not be the place where we advertise or promote new mission trips. You can find that infromation on [the main website](https://thecgcs.org/trips).

Feel free to check back on this page at a later date. If you would like to contact us directly, feel free to do so at [our main website](https://thecgcs.org).
