## During the Trip

---

 1. Have quiet time every morning before going out to do ministry.
 2. Keep a daily journal.
    * The journal will include a witnessing log, significant events, insights, and praises.
    * This is to be a practice of expectation, thanksgiving, and prayer in your lives.
    * This will be submitted to CampusNet after the trip is complete.
 3. Write a donor letter to thank those who made going more affordable for SEBTS students.
 4. Fully participate in all activities.
 5. Be humble, kind, compassionate, and tender-hearted.

 7. Maintain security if in a secure location.
 8. Partner well with local workers and nationals in ministry.
 9. If instructed, take photos and videos to send to the CGCS Communication Specialist.
