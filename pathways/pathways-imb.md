Pathways » IMB is a cooperative equipping cohort facilitated by the [Center for Great Commission Studies](https://thecgcs.org) at [Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary](https://sebts.edu) in partnership with the International Mission Board (IMB).  We hope to streamline the process of onboarding new missionaries and simplify the application process for those wanting to go. The IMB has worked hard with our association to create a process that both meets their requirements and allows us the freedom to design a system that meets the unique needs of our churches.
