## Why Should We Keep HubSpot?

1. HubSpot is a streamlined database that is capable of reporting, hosting, emailing, and tracking students in one place. This reduces the need to have multiple different software programs that communicate with one another. This is a great strength for HubSpot.
2. HubSpot is currently used to delineate our pathways at the CGCS. The Pastor's Center has also joined in this effort. They are onboarding users to utilize this software and track their students in a better way.
3. HubSpot's tracking software for emails is expansive and allows us to log emails, but also track who has opened them and what they clicked on inside the email. The data from marketing emails through HubSpot helps us leverage later emails in a greater way.
4. HubSpot's reporting capabilities are intuitive and combine many features of a contact's profile seamlessly. We are able to report on a contact's interaction with us, the website, and any events they may have gone to at SEBTS.
    - With the addition of the Pastor's Center, they are looking to utilize the reporting features to give reports for their new grant.
5. If we were to upgrade to an enterprise level, we would receive SSO, custom objects, and a greater level of reporting. This would enable us to do more than we already do with HubSpot.
6. HubSpot helps us visualize where exactly our students are on the path towards ministry preparation and calling. This helps our staff see areas of strength and weakness as we attempt to serve the school and the Lord in fulfilling the Great Commission.
7. HubSpot expedites the process of gathering student interaction and hosts it in one place. We are able to visualize how a student sees their calling and our interaction as an office with those students. For example, if the student were to talk to Keelan or Rick, these meetings would be recorded, and we could utilize this information to better serve them in the future.
8. HubSpot's importing feature to update contacts is simple and easy to use. It takes seconds to upload material to update or create contacts.
9. HubSpot makes emailing segments of our students easy. We are able to mark their interests, desired pathways, and mission trip attendance, as well as previous ministry experience. This enables us to utilize these properties for targeted email lists, garnering better engagement and interest in our students.
    - The targeted emails produced good engagement during Global Missions Week, which was a huge win for our office.
10. HubSpot integrates with our current form software, which allows for data transfer through the HubSpot plug-in on WordPress.
11. Replicating HubSpot with a custom build would take months, as well as a great amount of time and money.
12. HubSpot has room to integrate more users, such as missions mobilizers, pastoral ministry mobilizers, and other staff members.
