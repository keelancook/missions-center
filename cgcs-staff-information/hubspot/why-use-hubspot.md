## Why Should We Keep HubSpot?

1. HubSpot is a streamlined database that is capable of reporting, hosting, emailing, and tracking students in one place. This reduces the need to have multiple different softwares that communicate with one another. This is a great strength for HubSpot.
2. HubSpot is currently used to delineate our pathways at the CGCS. The Pastor's Center has expressed interest in joining the pathways effort, especially with pastoral ministry students. It would be very easy to add the Pastor's Center on and not disrupt any information or rhythms on HubSpot.
3. HubSpot's tracking software in emails is expansive and allows us to log emails, but also track who has opened the emails and what they have clicked on inside the email. The data from marketing emails through HubSpot helps us leverage later emails in a greater way.
4. HubSpot's reporting capabilities are intuitive and combine many features of a contact's profile seamlessly. We are able to report on a contact's interaction with us, the website, and any events they may have gone to at SEBTS.
5. If we were to upgrade to an Enterprise level, we would receive SSO, custom objects, and a greater level of reporting. This would enable us to do more than we already are with HubSpot.
6. HubSpot helps us to visualize where exactly our students are on the path towards ministry preparation and calling. This helps our staff see areas of strength and weakness as we attempt to serve the school and the Lord in fulfilling the Great Commission.
7. HubSpot expedites the process of gathering student interaction and hosts it in one place. We are able to visualize how a student sees their calling and our interaction as an office with those students. For example, if the student were to talk to both Keelan and Rick, these meetings would be recorded and we can utilize this information to better serve them in the future.
8. HubSpot's importing feature to update contacts is simple and easy to use. It takes seconds to upload material to update or create contacts.
9. HubSpot makes emailing segments of our students easy. We are able to mark them with interests, desired pathways, and mission trip attendance, as well as previous ministry experience. This enables us to utilize these properties for targeted email lists, garnering better engagement and interest in our students.
