# Pathways

The pathways we are developing for students are held in HubSpot. These pathways are held in the sales tab through the deal mechanism. Below is a list of the current pathways, along with the steps that we currently have in place for students to follow. There is also some front-facing material and flowcharts. A student can easily be moved along these pathways by adjusting the deal stage the student resides in on the pipeline.

### International Missions
The International Missions pathway is designed to help students GO to the nations. This pathway is integrated with Company resources to enable you to discover your calling and place. As a student, you will be guided, trained, and challenged to do evangelism and engage cross-culturally. You will be taught some about the Core Missionary Task, and you will walk alongside like-minded students in engaging the nation. The goal of this pathway is for you to GO to the nations; God is leading you!
