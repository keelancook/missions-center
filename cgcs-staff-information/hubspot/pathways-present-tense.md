# Pathways

The pathways we are developing for students are held in HubSpot. These pathways are held in the sales tab through the deal mechanism. Below is a list of the current pathways, along with the steps that we currently have in place for students to follow. There is also some front-facing material and flowcharts. A student can easily be moved along these pathways by adjusting the deal stage the student resides in on the pipeline.
