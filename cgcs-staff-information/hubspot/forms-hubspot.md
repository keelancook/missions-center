## HubSpot Forms

---

### Form Information

HubSpot forms are a great way to automate information collection. Each question on a HubSpot form is tied to a property, so when a form is filled out, the information is automatically added or updated on a contact's profile. You cannot have a question if there is no property for that question. When creating a new question on a form, this automatically creates a new property. Make sure that you realize this. When you make a new question through forms, IT CREATES A NEW PROPERTY. Be careful not to flood HubSpot with properties. Search through the properties already created to see if one can be reworded to fit the question you need.  

Currently, we are utilizing Gravity Forms through WordPress for our information collection. For more information on Gravity Forms [click here.](/cgcs-staff-information/wordpress/wordpress-forms.html)
