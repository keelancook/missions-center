## HubSpot Forms

---

### Form Information

HubSpot forms are a great way to automate information collection. Each question on a HubSpot form is tied to a property, so when a form is filled out, the information automatically is added or updated on a contact's profile. You cannot have a question if there is not a property for that question. When creating a new question on a form, this automatically creates a new property. Make sure that your realize this. When you make a new question through forms, IT CREATES A NEW PROPERTY. Be careful not to flood HubSpot with properties. Search through the properties already created to see if one can be reworded to fit the question you need.  

Currently, we are utilizing Wufoo forms for data collection. These forms do not connect to HubSpot. Thus, we are looking to migrate away from Wufoo and move to a form software that does connect to HubSpot, or use HubSpot itself. At the moment, we have arrived at using Gravity Forms through WordPress.
