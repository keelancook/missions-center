## Dashboards and Reporting

---

### Dashboards

Dashboards are a one stop shop for report management. These are customizable views that can be named based on the reports placed upon them. Dashboards can host all sorts of reports and enable you to quickly find out information for the given inquiry. Currently, in HubSpot, there are five dashboards: Historical Data, Student Breakdown, Company Information, Mission Trip Statistics, and Website Visits and Engagements. More dashboards can be created if a need arises. To do so, just go to the create dashboards button. You can make a dashboard from scratch or from a template.

Dashboards:
Historical Data: This shows historical student data, such as graduation numbers, mission degree population, and more.

Student Breakdown: These reports display the current active student population and delineate how many people are in missions degrees on campus. This also shows the current breakdown of desired pathways.

Company Information: This dashboard hosts the intersection between Southeastern and the Company. It tells us some information about how many we may have sent with them and how many students currently are serving with them.

Mission Trip Statistics: This dashboard hosts current and historical data about mission trips. It shows how many students have gone on trips, how many trips we have led per year, and what faculty may have led a trip.

Website Visits and Engagements: This dashboard holds reports about the traffic on our website. This information tells us how active our site is and how many people visit it on a daily basis.

### Reporting

Reporting is the process of making charts, graphs, or other displays based upon our needs. You can make single object reports or use the custom report builder with the subscription level we currently have. All reports are housed in the reports list and can be added to created dashboards. Currently, we have reports on student data, mission trips, company intersection with SEBTS, and student history. These are all contact based reports. You can also create reports with deals and companies. You can also analyze activities such as meetings and emails. Reporting takes practice, playing with the properties that you want to get the data as accurate and presentable as possible. This takes time to learn and doesn't come without failures. Keep trying different options until you get the look you want!
