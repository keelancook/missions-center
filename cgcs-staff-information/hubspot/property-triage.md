## Property Levels

### Level 1: Needed Properties
   * Record ID, Student First and Last name, Student ID, Student Email, Student Degree, Student Program, Student Major, Student Desired Pathway/Ministry Calling, Student Mission Experience, Student Previous Ministry Experience, Student IMB Status, all mission trip properties, Employee names, employee emails.

### Level 2: Useful Properties
   * Student preferred email, preferred name, student status, Employee ID, Faculty Designation, student phone number.

### Level 3: Not Needed Properties
   * Student GPA, student classes completed, student credits completed, student Social, student children information, student birth date, student prior degrees, student health data, student financial records, student emergency contact information (except for those who submit that to us for mission trips. Will not store in Hubspot).

## Ways of Gathering Data
   * The CGCS utilizes forms for events, mission trips, and other activities. Not all forms will correspond to Hubspot properties. However, a good amount of forms will utilize many of the properties above. Some form software can integrate directly with Hubspot which allows us to integrate this with our database, creating less work to manually input or import our data repeatedly.
   * To get data for the CRM, we have utilized Powercampus and other databases via Registrar, FAAD, Financial Aid, and HR. The people you might need to ask for this data changes regularly, but someone in this office should be able to help you find the data you need. After you receive data from them, you would then import that into HubSpot.

## Property List
This is not an exhaustive list of the properties in HubSpot, but this should get you acclimated to what kind of data that the CGCS stores in HubSpot.

### General

Record ID – This is the number given to a new contact after import. This is assigned by Hubspot and can be used to import information for contacts later. This information cannot be changed.

### Students

Student First Name – This property is used to designate a student’s first name. It is stored in the first name property overall. This is the given first name from PowerCampus. Some students have submitted forms using their chosen first name as well. This data is stored under first name. The last used first name with associated email is what is kept.  

Student Last Name – This property is used to designate a student’s last name. This is the given last name from PowerCampus. Some students have submitted forms using their last name as well. This data is stored under last name. The last used name with associated email is what is kept.  

Student Preferred Name - This property is used to designate the name a student prefers to go by instead of their given first name. This could be a nickname, middle name, etc. This property is one that we made and is not needed in making records.

Student Email – This property is used to designate a student’s email with the school. This is the student email found in PowerCampus. We have tried to import all active students and all alumni.

Student Degree – This is the student’s degree at Southeastern. This designates if they are getting a BA, BS, MA, MDIV, EDD, DMIN, PHD, etc. Hubspot only stores the last known degree.

Options currently include journeyman, IMB career, pastor, NAMB Church planter, Go2, GenSend, HandsOn, Nehemiah Teams, International Missionary (Other than IMB), church planter (other than NAMB), SEBTS Graduate, SEBTS Missionary Graduate (ICP) (this gives us an easy marker for ICP graduates since our system does not store more than one degree), SEBTS Missionary Graduate (Macedonia), IMB Missionary Kid, and SEBTS Professor. This data is used on varying contacts and helps us identify who has worked for the IMB or who has connections with the IMB, as well as other roles our students have fulfilled.  

Student IMB Scholarship Status – This property designates students who have received financial aid from the IMB. We received this data from the office of Financial Aid.
