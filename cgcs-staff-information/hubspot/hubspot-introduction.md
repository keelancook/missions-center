### What is HubSpot? 
HubSpot is a software that connects a team's marketing and sales tools to a CRM Database. **[Click here](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/get-started)** a link to HubSpot's knowledge base to get started. HubSpot has an incredible knowledge base themselves that enables people to seek out answers easily. Be sure to make use of this material!

### What is a CRM database?
CRM stands for customer relationship management. A CRM database is a database that holds information on customers that helps organizations manage and analyze customer interactions and data. A CRM typically compiles customer data across different points of contact between the customer and organization. These might include phone calls, texts, emails, or meetings.

### What are we using a CRM for?
Here in the CGCS, our customers are students and the organization is the Center, as well as the school. We are utilizing HubSpot's CRM to capture student data, especially a student's interactions with the CGCS. Since the CGCS is seeking to provide aid to a student in ministry preparation and calling, it is important for us to know the kind of information we have given to a student when going into a meeting.

### What else are we using HubSpot for?
We are also using HubSpot as a database to track mission trip participants and host our pathways interaction. We are utilizing the deals and pipeline features to track where a student is at on their journey here at SEBTS. For example, a student in their first semester comes to the CGCS and indicates they are interested in international missions. How do we get them from interested to going after they graduate? The deals and pipelines feature tracks a student on their journey to being sent out to participate in international missions. This pipeline is intentionally built around our denominational partnership with the IMB.
