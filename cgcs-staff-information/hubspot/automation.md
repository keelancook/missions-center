## Automation
Automation is the building of automated workflows to do tasks for you. Examples of automation include sending an email to someone who has just completed a form, building workflows to set contacts to a certain lifecycle stage if a deal stage is reached, or formulating email sequences to send out after a certain delay. Automation is there to make menial tasks easier, but it is not to be used to get rid of your task completely.

### Sequences
Sequences are timed, targeted emails that are sent in a recurring fashion. These emails tend to be ticklers that are sent out repeatedly to attract attention to your product. To use sequences, you must hold a professional sales seat. On our current subscription, 5 seats are allocated. Ask if you do not know what this means!

### Workflows
Workflows are the tools you use to create automation. They can be as simple as two steps or as complex as 10 steps with branching logic. Workflows have different uses, but all are meant to provide automation to routine tasks that you perform, such as a follow-up email that is sent out after a form submission. Since workflows can be quite complex, it is good to spend some time figuring out what you want the workflow to do before publishing it. HubSpot has some excellent help on creating workflows.
