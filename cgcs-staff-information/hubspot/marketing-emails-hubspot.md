## Marketing Emails

---

### Create an Email

To send out emails to a broad audience (a marketing email, not a one-to-one email), go to the marketing tab in the top menu bar. Select emails from that drop down. This will bring you to the email home page. From this point, you can either create a new email or look at the performance of old emails that you have already sent out. You can also choose to clone old emails to resend them at a later date. This enables you to reuse old emails and not completely write new emails.

To write a new email, select create email in the top right corner.
