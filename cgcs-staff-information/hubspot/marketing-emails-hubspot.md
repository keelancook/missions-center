## Marketing Emails

### Create an Email

To send out emails to a broad audience (a marketing email, not a one-to-one email), go to the marketing tab in the top menu bar. Select emails from that drop down. This will bring you to the email home page. From this point, you can either create a new email or look at the performance of old emails that you have already sent out. You can also choose to clone old emails to resend them at a later date. This enables you to reuse old emails and not completely write new emails.

To write a new email, select create email in the top right corner. You can then choose if you want this email to be a regular email, an automated email, or a blog email. Most of the time, you will choose regular email. This will allow you to attach it to a workflow or send them to a segment of our contacts. At times, you might be creating one specifically to add to a workflow, such as sending an internal email to our mobilizers every time a new student indicates that they are interested in one of our pathways.

After selecting regular email, you can choose from many templates to use for your email. Choose the template that you think works the best for your email. After this, design your email!

After designing your email, go to the settings tab and choose who you would like to send this email from and enter the subject and preview text. You can also name this email internally so you know what this email contains without having to open it. You will then select a subscription type for the email. Most of the time this will be marketing information, but also could be newsletter or student subscription. You can add to the subscription types in the settings.

### Audience

After designing and choosing the settings for your email, you will go to the send or schedule tab. It is here you will choose the audience for your email. You will do this by choosing the recipients who will receive the email. Here, you can choose individual contacts, or utilize the lists feature from contacts. You can select a list that has already been made. For example, let's say we are going to send an email to students who are interested in going on one of our mission trips. To send an email to this specific audience, all you have to do is select the list that contains those students who have indicated that they are interested in that mission trips. These lists have already been made and are readily available to use!

You can also select contacts whom you do not want to receive an email. Again, this could be individual contacts or a list of contacts.

At this point, you can choose to send the email now, or schedule it for later. When scheduling, you might notice that the email has an estimated recipient number. You might see that many of these contacts are not going to receive the email. Why is this you ask? There are many options, but a main one with how we are running HubSpot at this point is that the contacts are not set to be a marketing contact. Now what is a marketing contact you might ask??

### What is a marketing contact?

A marketing contact is a contact that we have designated as able to receive marketing emails. All those who receive our newsletter are set as marketing contacts automatically. On our current subscription level, we can only have 1000 contacts designated as marketing contacts. So, we turn these on and off to fit our current needs.

To turn these on, go to the list that you intend to send the email. Then select all the contacts. In the more tab next to actions, select 'set as marketing contacts.' It is that easy! This turns them all into marketing contacts. You can now send your email to your intended list.

If there are too many marketing contacts, you are able to turn some of those off. Make sure that you are not turning off any newsletter subscribers, but only those who are students who should be turned off and on.

At this point, you are ready to send your email! You are able to add automation to this email if you would like. See the page on automation for more information here.
