## GitHub.dev
GitHub.dev is an editing and coding experience that runs entirely in your browser. This makes making and committing code changes quite easy. You can open any repository in the developer side. All you have to do is hit the period button when in a local repository. Another option is to press '>'. This opens the developer repository on a new tab instead of in the same window. GitHub.dev is available to everyone for free and is a combination of GitHub and VS code (or visiual studio code). At the moment, this is the most pain-free and easy way to manipulate our pages on GitHub.
