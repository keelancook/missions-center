## Markdown
What in the world is markdown? Well, thanks for asking. Markdown is a simple and lightweight language that allows you to add formatting elements through the use of plaintext elements. For example, to create a heading, all you have to do is add a number sign before the heading (e.g. # Heading). There are various plaintext elements that allow you to bold, italicize, and more! Yet, it is all done in plaintext! How cool! There are already great guides to get you started, and so I am just going to link you to those here instead of retyping all the great work others have done!

Why am I telling you this again? Well, it is because GitHub (and many other applications) utilize markdown and are able to convert these plaintext elements into formatting elements. This is quite a useful and simple language for you to learn and apply in many facets of your life. So you might as well start learning!
