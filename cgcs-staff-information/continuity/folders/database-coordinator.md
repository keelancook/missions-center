### In-house
* Your direct supervisor for HubSpot and the documentation website is the Associate Director.
* Your direct supervisor for your hours and HR is the office manager.
* You will work together with other team members on projects throughout your time in the office.

### Outside the Office
* This role has some contact with outside offices at SEBTS. IT, Financial Aid, Registrar, and HR are offices that you may need to contact for information on HubSpot.
   * To connect your email inbox in HubSpot, you will need to first contact IT. The person to contact is Wayne Jenks. They need to add the email to the HubSpot Sales group on their end before you can connect the inbox.
   * For updates on student information, the first place to contact is IT. Dai Oliveira has pulled these reports lately. However, Will Johnston at the Registrar was also very helpful in populating student information and can be contacted as a last resort.
* With the development of pathways and pipelines, this role also involves contact with members of Company, NAMB, and NC Baptists. These are our denominational partners, and we are seeking to build sending pathways in tandem with these organizations.
   * Since these contacts may be changing, you will need to do some research on who to contact at the Company, NAMB, and NC Baptists. Keelan helped me find these contacts and can help you whenever they are needed.
* This role also has contact with HubSpot, from contract teams to success and aid teams, to troubleshooting teams. All of these offices at HubSpot are here to help you in this role, pointing you in the right direction and to articles that may help with your issues and needs.

* Regulations surrounding student data and PII are pertinent. Make sure that you are up to date on these.

* Deduply: Deduply is an integration with HubSpot that helps with duplicate records. It costs money per month, but it can be well worth the time and effort it saves. You will probably only need this in the most dire of circumstances.

## Calendar of Events/Tasks
This can include subscription renewals and important dates or events in the office.  

Fall Semester:
* In the fall semester, around the beginning of September, you will need to request graduation data and new student data from the IT department.
* Gathering Chapel
   * This chapel is one of the first chapel services of the fall semester. It highlights Southeastern's desire to GO and is the place where we introduce our lineup for mission trips to the students.
   * You will help develop a form for this service and do whatever the director asks of you for this chapel.
* HubSpot Renewal
   * HubSpot renews on the 9th of November for 2023 to 2024. This is subject to change if we decide to renew early. You need to be aware of this date because you will be in charge of aiding the renewal process and communicating with HubSpot.

Spring Semester:
* Global Missions Week
   * Typically, the second week in February. All staff in the CGCS are expected to contribute. You will need to be present at all events and meetings about Global Missions Week.
* Go Conference
   * A conference that is geared toward aiding students in discovering their calling and ministry. Attendance at this conference is not required, but it is helpful.
   * This conference is typically held the weekend before Global Missions Week.
* Commissioning Chapel
   * This is one of the last chapel services during the spring semester. This chapel celebrates sending at Southeastern and highlights students being sent. This is typically graduating students.
   * We have also begun to highlight the number of students currently serving overseas as well.
* In the spring semester, around the beginning of February, you will need to request graduation data and new student data from the IT department.  

Summer Semester:
* No major events. The goal is to get caught up and prepared for the fall semester.
* Mission Trips go out during the whole year, and this is one of the times that a lot of trips happen. Be available for any need that may occur.

## Lessons Learned
1. Do not be afraid to ask questions, of Keelan, IT, or others at SEBTS.
2. If you are having an issue with HubSpot, people have probably experienced this before. Utilize HubSpot's customer support calling and documentation. This is a huge resource for you.
3. Do not be afraid to fail when it comes to GitHub. Sometimes an action does not deploy, but it can be fixed. Failing is a way forward in this regard.
4. Take advantage of conversations you can have in the office. Keelan, Kelly, and other staff members are there for you. Enjoy your time. Having conversations about missions, church, and other topics are a great way to expand your knowledge while at SEBTS.
5. Student Data Privacy is a primary concern. Make sure this is at the forefront of what you are doing.
6. Seek ways to serve other staff members. This role is fluid and enables you to do some tasks intermittently.
7. Be flexible.
