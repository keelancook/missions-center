## What are staff/employer expectations?
Employer expectations are the set of standards, behaviors, and performance criteria that employers have for their employees. These expectations are essential for maintaining a productive and efficient work environment. Here are some common employer expectations:

### Job Performance
Employers expect employees to perform their job tasks competently and efficiently. This includes meeting deadlines, achieving targets, and consistently delivering high-quality work.

### Reliability
Employers rely on employees to arrive at work on time and consistently meet their work schedules. Dependability is crucial to ensure smooth operations.

### Professionalism
Employers expect employees to conduct themselves professionally, which includes dressing appropriately for the workplace, using respectful language and behavior, and adhering to company policies and codes of conduct.

### Accountability
Employers want employees to take responsibility for their actions and decisions. This includes owning up to mistakes, learning from them, and working to improve.

### Teamwork and Collaboration
In most workplaces, teamwork is essential. Employers expect employees to work well with others, share information, and contribute to a positive team atmosphere.

### Adaptability
The business environment is often dynamic, so adaptability is highly valued. Employers expect employees to be open to change, willing to learn new skills, and able to pivot when necessary.

### Initiative
Employers appreciate employees who show initiative by taking on additional responsibilities, seeking opportunities for improvement, and proposing new ideas that can benefit the company.

### Communication Skills
Effective communication is vital in the workplace. Employers expect employees to communicate clearly, both verbally and in writing, and to actively listen to colleagues and supervisors.

### Ethical Behavior
Employers have high expectations for ethical conduct. They expect employees to adhere to legal and ethical standards in all business dealings and interactions.

### Productivity and Efficiency
Employers want employees to use their time and resources efficiently to achieve their goals and contribute to the company's success.

### Conflict Resolution
Conflict can arise in any workplace. Employers expect employees to handle conflicts professionally, seeking solutions that are in the best interest of the company and its employees.

### Continuous Learning
Many industries evolve rapidly. Employers often expect employees to engage in ongoing learning and professional development to stay current in their field.

### Meeting Deadlines
Employers rely on employees to meet project deadlines and fulfill commitments made to clients, customers, and colleagues.

### Alignment with Company Values and Goals
Employers value employees who understand and support the company's mission, vision, and values. They expect employees to work toward the achievement of the organization's goals.

It's important for employees to be aware of these expectations and strive to meet them to maintain a positive working relationship with their employer. Effective communication between employers and employees can also help clarify expectations and address any concerns or issues that may arise. Additionally, employers should provide feedback, guidance, and resources to help employees meet these expectations and succeed in their roles.
