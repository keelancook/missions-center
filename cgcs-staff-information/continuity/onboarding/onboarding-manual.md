## What is the office atmopshere like?
The office atmosphere is laid back and jovial. Here at the CGCS, we want to see God glorified and students challenged to reach the nation. We foster an atmosphere of curiosity and open doors. We work as a team and each staff member has their hand in different pieces of the puzzle.

## What is the process for requesting days off?

### Full-time
Full-time staff should submit their time off requests at least two weeks in advance to Kelly Garner and Keelan Cook. Supervisors will promptly review and approve or deny requests, considering their impact on departmental operations and staffing. Approved requests will be communicated to the staff member with necessary details, and supervisors will adjust schedules accordingly. Records of approved and denied requests will be maintained by the CGCS. Staff members are responsible for returning to work as scheduled, and any changes to approved time off should be communicated in advance.

### Part-Time
Part-time staff are more flexible in their time off, as they are working a smaller number of hours. However, part-time staff should submit their time off requests at least two weeks in advance to Kelly Garner and Keelan Cook. Approved requests will be communicated to the staff member with necessary details, and supervisors will adjust schedules accordingly. Records of approved and denied requests will be maintained by the CGCS. Staff members are responsible for returning to work as scheduled, and any changes to approved time off should be communicated in advance. In working part-time, you may also work more hours the week before and week after to make up the time you are missing. Discuss how to do this with Kelly Garner when this becomes pertinent.

## What about chapel?
Full-time and part-time staff receive one paid chapel a week. You are allowed to stay on the clock during this hour and sit under preaching and worship with other SEBTS staff and students. We encourage you to participate in chapel! It is of great benefit to you as you grow in your relationship with the Lord.
