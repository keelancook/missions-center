# Continuity Folders

### What is a continuity folder?
A continuity folder is a reference document produced by an individual to share relevant information concerning their job. This is so that when a person leaves, they can pass on all tasks and job information to the person who takes their position. This typically includes screenshots, task lists, job description, job responsibilities, onboarding manuals, and archives for that position.

### Why should we have a continuity folder?
Every worker should have a continuity folder because it makes the process of transition that much easier. If a person were to take over your job, or if you were to start all over again, think about how much easier it would be to begin if you had a list of tasks and how to do them, alongside the expectations that were already given to you.

### What goes in to a continuity folder?
A continuity folder typically includes task lists, job description, job responsibilities, onboarding manuals, screenshots of common website buttons, and archives for that position.

### How often should I update my continuity folder?
You can update your continuity folder every time you do a task. If you use your continuity folder to complete tasks at times, you will see its accuracy and usefulness. The easiest time to build a continuity folder is when you are starting out on a job, but it is never too late to begin!

### Can you give me an example of a continuity folder?
