# CGCS Space Breakdown

---

### Is your current workspace supporting your daily tasks, productivity, and overall assisting you in SEBTS mission to equip students to serve the church and fulfill the great commission?
Yes __X__
No ____
 
#### Current Allocation:
  * Front Office (JS 133): This is the space designated for the office manager and the administrative assistant to the Director of the CGCS. At the moment, the office manager is Kelly Garner and the admin assistant is Timothy Waters. This space needs to be redesigned. The Director's office, associate director's office, third office, fishbowl, and back hallway are all located off of this location and utilize the same entrance door.
  * Director's Office: This office is intended for the director of the CGCS. Right now, this is Keelan Cook. This office is lined with bookshelves, has a place for meetings with the director, and includes the director desk.
  * Associate director's Office: This office is intended for the associate director of the CGCS. Right now, this is empty, but will hopefully be filled soon! This office is lined with bookshelves, has a place for meetings with the director, and includes the director desk.
  * Third Office: This office is being utilized by our Company MAG roles (Rick and Nancy Fraley). This office is lined with bookshelves, has a place for meetings with the director, and includes the director desk.
  * Fishbowl: This is our conference room we have in the CGCS. It is a great space for us to work, have group meetings, or hold luncheons. It includes a large whiteboard and television that we can cast to when needed. There is a large table that seats eight to ten people.
  * Back Hallway: This is where the printer, coffee station, and four cubicles are located. There is also a closet off of this hallway that holds CGCS resources. In each cubicle there is an outlet, a desk, and filing cabinet. These could potentially use an update, but no real reason to spend money here as they work well.
  * Sam-James Room/Braswell Library (JS 122): This space is currently being used for classrooms and larger meetings for the CGCS. It also has a secondary closet that the CGCS uses to hold materials for hosting events such as plates, napkins, cups, and more. We have very little access to the Sam-James room because it is now listed as a classroom. This means that we rarely get to use it for meetings, making some of the changes for space more necessary.
  * Missions Rotunda: This is the large circular space outside of the CGCS where the flags are currently located, along with a stained glass piece. This is largely underutilized for the CGCS and needs some changes.
  * Jacumin-Simpson Foyer: This is the location with the large globe, high tables, and bookshelves that hold prayer cards. It is currently underutilized by the CGCS.
  * Jacumin-Simpson 236 (Closet): This is a second floor closet that currently belongs to the CGCS. We use this closet to store mission trip material, the Christmas decorations, and other SEBTS/CGCS paper products. This is a key closet that stores our historical records.
  * Jacumin-Simpson 111 (Closet): This closet is on the first floor, located off a wing of Eitel Auditorium. This closet has a label of electrical room, but is actually a closet and is currently being used by the drama club as a storage facility with the approval of the CGCS.
 
### What are some possible ways to improve your space to make it more effective?  
   Some possible ways to improve the space here at the CGCS deals with the Missions Rotunda and the Jacumin-Simpson Foyer. Both of these are in need of an update to enable the CGCS and Southeastern to utilize this space more. The bookshelves holding prayer cards are out of date and need to be replaced with an electronic system. This system would be more easily utilized by our missionaries and enable them to connect more easily with students on campus. The stained glass takes up needed space in the middle of the rotunda, making events difficult to host. Opening up both this area and the area with the globe would be a huge upgrade to this location. This would makes hosting events easier and give the space a fresh look to facilitate missions partnerships for years to come.  
  
   Another way to improve the space for the CGCS is to remove the window at the desk where the admin assistant sits. This window makes Timothy out to be an information attendant for anyone in the building. If this window was removed, people could easily come inside to speak with our office manager, Kelly. We could also utilize this wall space for a large map or another television to highlight ongoing mission work.

   A third way to improve our space and make it more effective is to give the front office space that houses Kelly and Timothy an upgrade. The desks and cabinets in this space are old and ineffective. There is a serious lack of storage space and the desks are outdated. We would like to request a removal of the current desk structures and replace them with newer regular desks that are not attached to the wall. This would enable us to use the space more efficiently. The file space and work areas in the current arrangement are limited and antiquated. At the same time, they are not suitable for efficient file systems. With these thoughts in mind, a replacement of the current desk structure is necessary. On top of this, the carpet in the front office around the desks is worn down, making it a tripping hazard. Overall, our main hope is to remove the current desk structures and get regular desks that will allow Timothy and Kelly to be more efficient.
 

### If there are any under or unutilized space(s) in your purview, please list the building, room number, and an explanation.  
As I mentioned above, the underutilized spaces in our office are the Missions Rotunda in Jacumin-Simpson and the Jacumin-Simpson Foyer. These tend to be empty a majority of the time and relatively few students hang out here with the update of Ledford and outdoor area that was just built. The building gets little traffic due to these things. If our focus here on campus is sending to the nations, this building should be bustling with students, yet it does not seem to be that way. The location does not seem inviting or conducive to student use. We do recognize that this location does serve as a space for faculty offices, and we would not like it to be loud all the time, but we do think that more student interaction with this space is necessary if we are focusing on the Great Commission and getting students to go.
 
### As you forecast the next 5 years, is there any information you feel would help facilities better serve you?  
The CGCS desires to be a center that helps facilitate student involvement with the Great Commission as well as partner with local churches and sending agencies to produce pipelines that will send to the nations. Right now, our office feels slightly outdated and is in need of a facelift to do this in the next generation. We need a space that inspires students and engages with them each and every day. The CGCS should be an attractive location for students to visit and hangout, yet that does not feel like the case right now. As we think about the next five years, we would love to see an increase in student involvement and denominational partnership. Yet, we lack a great hosting space for large groups, while also lacking a space for students to just hang out. Some of the changes above are intended to help facilitate these changes. Since we also want to be a resource for the community, some greater front-facing options for the Foyer and Rotunda are quite needed.
