# WordPress Introduction

### What is WordPress?
WordPress is an open-source software that was designed to help developers build websites. This site creator was designed for all levels, engaging even the most novice of developers. It offers powerful features, security, performance, and accessibility. The CGCS uses WordPress to host its marketing site. It presents a seamless and beautifully designed site for us, operated and maintained by UsefulGroup.

### Why are we using WordPress?
The CGCS is using WordPress because the SEBTS main website and all the center sites are there. We also use it because it is fairly straightforward to navigate and figure out. WordPress is also linked to HubSpot and is the location of our form software, [Gravity Forms](/cgcs-staff-information/wordpress/wordpress-forms.html). We utilize WordPress for advertising, blog posts, and social media integration. The WordPress site is mostly maintained by the digital communications specialist. WordPress can also contain media, photos, graphics, and videos in the media tab on the left tool bar.

### What is the URL for our WordPress site?
The URL for our wordpress page is [https://thecgcs.org/](thecgcs.org).

### Who do we contact for help on WordPress?
For help with WordPress, you may talk to our digital communications specialist, communications at SEBTS, and then UsefulGroup. For their contact information and this process, talk with the digital communications specialist.
