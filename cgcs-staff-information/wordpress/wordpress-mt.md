# WordPress Mission Trip Applications

### General Information

As mentioned in the forms page, WordPress hosts all our forms. Thus, WordPress also hosts our mission trip applications. This started with the Fall Break Trips in 2023. Earlier trips utilized Wufoo. We no longer have our Wufoo account, and so those forms are gone. However, we have the sheets with all participants in the OneDrive and in HubSpot.

### What Mission Trip forms are there?

Gravity Forms holds the mission trip applications and the BLANK applications. We have three blank applications to duplicate when a new trip occurs. Those three blank applications include:
* Mission Trip Application with Flight Included for Stateside Trips
* Mission Trip Application with Flight Included for International Trips
* Mission Trip Application without Flight for Stateside Trips
    * Each of these are blank applications that users can duplicate to create new applications. Each of these the proper questions, conditional logic, notifications, and confirmations set up.
* The Mission Trip Application for all Mission Trips
    * Labeled MT - [Location] Time of Year(SB, WB, FB, Summer) and Year
    * They are labeled this way to easily organize and identify the trip without having to open the application.

### What do we need in order to properly update the blank forms?

* Timing of Trip (Fall Break, Winter Break, Spring Break, Summer Break)
* Exact Dates of Trip (leaving and returning)
* Number Of Students Able to Go (So we can limit the number of applications to the appropriate amount)
* The cost of the entire trip
* The amount for the trip deposit
* The date we are going to be opening the application (day application is going live!)
* If the trip has a flight or not associated with it.
* If the trip will be SEBTS hosted, or church hosted (like the Faith trip).

There are various spots throughout the application that need updating:

1. In the form settings page, the form title and description need updating.
2. In the form settings page, in the restrictions section, the entry limit, schedule, and pending message need to be updated.
    * **Ensure that you save the page at the bottom before leaving or the settings you just changed will not go into effect.**  

In the application itself (under the edit page):
3. The amount for the deposit at the top needs to be changed.
4. The location of the trip in the question "Where is this trip going?"
5. In the Financial liability section, the amount of the trip, the deposit, and the financial deadlines all need to be updated.
6. In the indemnity Agreement and Release, the location, term (FB, WB, SB, Summer), and exact dates need to be updated.
    * **When updating these, always save the form at the top of the page to enact the changes.**
