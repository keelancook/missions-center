We are currently developing the web resources for onboarding students into the Great Commission Pathways initiative. Soon, we hope to provide a clear way to assess students for calling and commission. This will allow us to work with every student to craft a custom plan for preparation to be sent down a particular pathway to the Great Commission, whether that is on the international mission field or somewhere in North America.

Feel free to check back on this page at a later date. If you would like to contact us directly, feel free to do so at [our main website](https://thecgcs.org).
