Welcome to the Mission Trip home page! This space is a repository for our documentation and manuals for mission trips provided through the [Center for Great Commission Studies](https://thecgcs.org){:target="_blank"}. This space is specifically for professors! There is a lot of information and many frequently asked questions, so we want a place online where students, faculty, and staff can find all of that information. 

{: .important }
This will not be the place where we advertise or promote new mission trips. You can find that information on [the main website](https://thecgcs.org/trips){:target="_blank"}.
