## Pre-Trip

---

Since CGCS mission trips are classes at Southeastern, our professors serve as the course instructor and trip leaders. Before a trip is approved, created, and opened, professors do initial groundwork to create a trip proposal. The CGCS wants all professors to have the option of developing a trip that could potentially be approved as a school trip. Occasionally, the CGCS will generate a trip based on a direct field request to our office and connect a professor to that requrest. However, our goal is for professors to develop their own trips with former students or IMB and NAMB field connections they may have.

### Trip Expectations: What makes a good mission trip?

**Context:** Southeastern partners closely with our denominational partners in field ministry. For this reason, we highly prioritize short-term trip options that work directly with IMB, NAMB, or state convention and association teams. While we may at times run a trip to serve with another partner, those trips will be the exception, not the norm. In addition, we love serving alongside Southeastern alumni on the field in Great Commission ministry. For that reason, the ideal trip is to serve internationally with an IMB field team with Southeastern graduates or students or a NAMB church plant or replant with alumni involved.

**Type of ministry:** Southeastern mission trips can be very flexible in the strategies and work employed on the ground; however, they are still a missions elective which requires them to include a significant amount of field-based missions activity. In other words, a CGCS mission trip is not study tour. It is a ministry practicum. In most instances, the ideal activity involve entry and evangelism work. We always like to see students getting the opportunity to share the gospel cross-culturally or in various North American contexts. Trips can also serve missionary teams in other parts of the missionary task, such as: discipling new believers, leadership development, or healthy church formation.


### Before the Trip is Approved and Promoted
As a professor is generating a trip prospectus, the following are things to do in preparation. If you want the information below in a checklist form **[click here.](/for-faculty/mission-trips-faculty/prospectus-checklist.html)**

1. Research food costs, place of stay, local travel, and ministry expenses.
   * While the CGCS does book air travel and transportation for the mission trip, the professor needs to research travel before submitting the prospectus to give an accurate projection for the cost of travel. This includes submitting a potential flight path and pricing. These details are extremely important for us to accurately plan trips and can run a mission trip overbudget by tens of thousands of dollars if the professor has not done the work in advance of researching costs.
   * You also need to research medical availability and access while on the trip for the various locations you will be visiting.
   * You will need to calculate a food/expense estimate PER DAY for trip members. This is often best done by asking the connection with the field team for an estimate.
   * You will need to include an estimate for ground transportation. 
     * This could include van rentals, daily public transportation expenses, ground transport to and from airport, etc.
   * You will need to include multiple options for place of stay. 
     * Our preference would be for you to go to places where housing is provided by the team on the ground.
     * This could either be group housing or discounted housing provided by local workers. You may also research AirBnBs or other group lodging.
     * A last option would be to stay in hotels, but this should be avoided as it is not the best stewardship of funds.
     * If a reasonable play of stay cannot be secured, the trip option will not work.
   * This also includes information about visas, immunizations, and the country's needs.
   * You also need to research **[medical availability](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/)** and access while on the trip for the various locations you will be visiting.
   * You also need to research the safety of the area you will be going. You can check some travel information at the **[U.S. State Department's website.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html)**
2. Be aware of local culture. Work directly with the field partners on the ground where the mission trip will be located, identifying needs and goals of current teams on the ground.
3. Submit a mission trip prospectus form by the end of the Spring semester for the following academic year.

### After Trip is Approved and is Promoted

 1. Develop a course syllabus that goes along with the mission trip.
    * This includes 500 pages of reading (minimum), a 3-to-5-page reflection paper integrating the academic and personal aspects of trip, and a prayer journal.
    * You can find syllabus templates [here](/mission-center/mission-trips/syllabus-template.html/).
 2. Help promote the trip in your classes, on campus, and on social media.
 3. Host a mandatory briefing with students to discuss expectations and goals for the trip.
    * Students fail the course if they do not attend.
    * Develop a list of expectations for students. Some examples may include the expectations that the CGCS has set for you, while others may include expectations from personal experience.
    * Go over specific orientation details.
    * Get 1-2 prayer requests from each student and send to CGCS Communication Specialist.
 4. Select trip scholarship recipients. The Financial Aid Office has created a scholarship for students specifically going on mission trips. You, as the professor, will be in charge of choosing the student(s) who will receive the scholarship.
 5. Pray for the Lord to open the hearts and minds of the people you will be attempting to reach.
 6. **Keep track of receipts or any items purchased before the trip for the trip.**
 7. Display humility and expect humility from your students.
 8. **Make sure your passport is up to date.**
 9. Prepare spiritually as well as physically.
10. Pack well.

## During Trip

---

 1. Interact with students and engage in mentorship. We expect you to be a leader who is personal and approachable. We expect you to lead out in the areas where you expect students to participate.
    * Professors are not necessarily responsible for daily lectures on missions and evangelism. However, they are encouraged to provide teaching during the course as it relates to missions, evangelism, the particular context of the trip, contextualization, etc.
    * Facilitate a time of processing in the evening after the day of ministry is over.
 2. Encourage prayer in the lives of students.
 3. Facilitate time to be in the Word and abide with the Lord. Encourage students to do the same.
 4. Remind students of their prayer journals.
 5. Get to know each of the students on the trip. Do not just focus on that one stellar student who you know well.
 6. Integrate academics with application. Note to your students the areas of integration with reading, lecture, or assignments.
 7. Be clear in leadership.
 8. Engage and encourage partners on the ground. Do not make life more difficult for them. You are there to encourage and help them.
 9. Maintain student safety throughout the trip.
10. Maintain nationals' security if in a secure location.
11. Train students on how to do evangelism and engage with the people group you are focusing on reaching.
12. Also, keep track of gospel conversations during the trip by discussing this with students daily. Do you best to keep record of this activity.
13. Partner with local workers and nationals in your ministry strategy.
14. Follow principles outlined in When Helping Hurts. Try not to leave local workers with unreal expectations to meet.
15. Debrief with students at the end of the trip. Discuss areas of growth and where you saw the Lord working.
16. **Keep track of receipts or any items purchased during the trip.**
17. Designate 1-2 students to send pictures, updates, and prayer requests to the CGCS Communications Specialist daily.
18. Ensure students are writing donor thank you letter.

## Post-Trip

---

1. Turn in a summary of the mission trip to CGCS Director. Outline any specific encouraging stories that came out of the mission trip and your estimate of gospel conversations.
   * This should include a rough estimate of gospel conversations and/or ministry that occurred
   * Any highlights from the trip
   * Any difficulties or student issues
2. Take notes on what you need to do differently when leading a trip next year. Always be thinking about how to better serve as you lead mission trips.
3. Ensure all students have turned in the appropriate coursework.
   * Make sure to collect the student's donor thank you letters. 
     * Faculty are responsible for collecting these on or after the trip and turning them into the CGCS.
   * Faculty will then grade the student assignments and submit their grades to registrar for the course as with any other course.
4. **Turn in receipts to *Kelly Garner* ASAP.**
5. Send to **CGCS Communication Specialist** a list of students who could share a story to promote mission trips in the future.
   * Select 1-2 students to share a testimony from the trip for the CGCS social media
6. Select trip scholarship recipients. The Financial Aid Office has created a scholarship for students specifically going on mission trips. You, as the professor, will be in charge of choosing the student(s) who will receive the scholarship.
   * Outstanding student performance and character on a short-term mission trip qualifies 1-2 students from each trip for a new scholarship from financial aid for the year
