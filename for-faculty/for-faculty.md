Welcome to the Faculty and Staff home page! This space is a repository for our faculty and staff here at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. This page will hold information on mission trips, documentation, and more.

## Equipping Portal
In this section, we desire that the site itself become a tool for training professors and faculty on how they can build a mission trip themselves, as well as encourage their students to be involved missionally in the community. Our goal is to provide a central location for faculty and staff to come to when they are equipping others to fulfill the Great Commission.

This will not be the place where we advertise or promote the CGCS. You can find that information on [the main website](https://thecgcs.org/trips).

Feel free to check back on this page at a later date. If you would like to contact us directly, feel free to do so at [our main website](https://thecgcs.org/contact/).
