Although the CGCS is not directly over the missions degrees at Southeastern, this page includes some of the information about our degree programs for undergraduate, graduate, and advanced students. Our desire is to serve you well as you seek to serve the Lord! Hopefully these pages will help you answer questions that you may have about degrees in the future!

Feel free to check back on this page at a later date. If you would like to contact us directly, feel free to do so at [our main website](https://thecgcs.org){:target="_blank"}.
