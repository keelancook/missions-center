Welcome to the Mission Trip home page! This space is a repository for our documentation and manuals for mission trips provided through the [Center for Great Commission Studies](https://thecgcs.org). This space is specifically for students! There is a lot of information and many frequensly asked questions, so we want a place online where students, faculty, and staff can find all of that information. 

This will not be the place where we advertise or promote new mission trips. You can find that information on [the main website](https://thecgcs.org/trips).

Feel free to check back on this page at a later date. If you would like to contact us directly, feel free to do so at [our main website](https://thecgcs.org/contact/).
