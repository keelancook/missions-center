## General Questions

---

### What is a missions practicum?
   * When looking at your degree requirements, you may have noticed a section telling you to choose a practicum option. A missions practicum is a class that blends hands-on learning with academic instruction. These come in three forms: North American Practicum, International Practicum, and Missions Practicum. The North American Practicum requirement is fulfilled by going on a mission trip to a location in North America with SEBTS. The International Practicum requirement is fulfilled by going on a mission trip to a location internationally with SEBTS. The missions practicum is an option of going on a trip with IMB, NAMB, or your church. See question 7 for more details about this option.

### How do I enroll in a missions practicum?
   * If you go on a mission trip with SEBTS, enrollment is completed for you by the CGCS. This will add you to the CampusNet page and make sure you receive credit for the class with Registrar. If you choose to do the missions practicum with NAMB, IMB, or your church option, you will contact the Field Credit Office at fieldcredit@sebts.edu.

### Do I have to go on an international trip to fulfill my missions practicum requirement?
   * If you are in an internationally focused degree, the answer is yes. If you are in a less specific degree like Missiology, then you can go on an international or North American trip to fulfill your requirements. If you are in a North American-focused degree, you are required to go on a North American trip.

### Do I have to be an on-campus student to go on mission trips?
   * No, anyone enrolled in any program at Southeastern is eligible for consideration on a mission trip hosted by the CGCS.

### If I go on more than one trip will the credit for the class still count?
   * Yes, the credit for a second or third trip will count as an elective.

### If I go on a mission trip, do I have to take the corresponding class?
   * Yes, there is no way around this requirement. Even if you don't need the credit, if you go on the trip, you take the class.

### Is there a way to get credit for a mission trip that I went on with my church?
   * Yes, for more information on requirements to earn credit for a mission trip completed outside of Southeastern please **[click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m3QhhdE3Ne8VLaM9pTtdEYD1YnAhA67R/view)**.

### How long does a mission trip with SEBTS typically last?
   * North American trips typically last around 7 days, while international trips typically last between 10 to 14 days. We require 5 days on the ground of ministry activity, thus needing a longer time to go internationally.

### Where can I go on a mission trip?
   * You are allowed to go anywhere that SEBTS is going! We offer a wide range of trips every year! These are open to all students!

### Where has SEBTS gone on trips before?
   * We have gone to many countries in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and South America. We have also gone on trips to many locations in North America such as Utah, Alaska, Florida, Houston, NYC, Toronto, Mexico, and Clarkston.

### What will I do on a mission trip?
   * The primary goal of a mission trip is to partner with workers on the field to do evangelism and outreach to a certain area. We want to expose you to cross-cultural communication and evangelism while on these trips. We want to see the Gospel spread to the ends of the earth! This is our primary call and goal when going on a mission trip. This can be done through a myriad of ways: door-knocking, VBS, sports camps, open-air preaching, etc.

### Who will we be working with on a mission trip?
   * You will most likely be working with IMB or NAMB personnel who are on the ground in your intended location. The personnel you will be working with are most likely connected to SEBTS through the professor leading your trip or the CGCS. At the same time, you might also be partnering with local believers in the area to see the Gospel go forth.

### How many other students will be on the trip with me?
   * You will be on the trip with around 8 to 12 students in total. The size of the trip depends on the demand and security of the location you will be going. Some locations can only take smaller teams.

### Can I bring my spouse? Children?
   * If your spouse is also a SEBTS student, then they can apply to go on the same trip you intend to go on. If your spouse is not a SEBTS student, then they are not allowed to go on the trip with you. The same goes for children. Bringing family on a mission trip is great, but it could potentially take away from your learning while on the trip. We desire to see you grow in that you might one day be able to lead your family on a mission trip together!

### What strategies will be implemented on a mission trip?
   * Our core strategy when going on a mission trip is to partner with local believers or local missionaries who work in the target area. We will partner with them, coming alongside their strategies and rhythms to get the Gospel to the nations. The IMB utilizes a strategic method called the Core Missionary Task (Entry, evangelism, discipleship, healthy church formation, leadership training, and partnership and exit). Partnering with IMB teams in one of these categories is a great way to implement strategy. Other strategies include aiding in-country churches with VBS, caring for in-country missionaries, diaspora work, replanting/revitalization work, and being involved in open-air preaching. The goal of our strategy should always be the fulfillment of the Great Commission

### Do students share rooms with other students or professors?
   * Depending on the housing arrangement, students will share rooms with other students. We try to avoid students rooming with professors.

### What is the process of applying for a mission trip?
   * To apply for a mission trip, you must go to **[our website](https://www.thecgcs.org/trips/)**. Here you will find a list of our mission trips and find information about when mission trip applications will be open. You will first fill out the mission trip application and then turn in your deposit. Your mission trip application will not be considered complete until you have submitted the application AND turned in your deposit.

### Do mission trips fill up?
   * Some mission trips are more popular than others. We encourage applying immediately when trips open to ensure your slot on the trip.

### What if I have medicines I need to bring?
   * Medicine is common to bring with you on a trip. Each country and airline is different in its policy about medicine. Check with the **[CDC here](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-abroad-with-medicine)** to find out more.

### Will there be medical assistance while we are in-country?
   * Depending on your destination, medical assistance can be sparse. Professors are advised to plan emergency medical options while in-country. If you are partnering with a team of local workers, they will also know the best way to get medical assistance while in-country. Medical access is different all around the world, so ask your professor about your destination's health care!

### Will I need to learn a new language to go on a mission trip?
   * You will not need to learn a new language to go on a mission trip. We do advise that you begin to read a little bit about the culture you will be interacting with on the mission trip. Your professor should help brief you about common customs and culture before you go on the trip.

### What expectations do the CGCS and SEBTS have of me while on the trip?
   * We expect students to be heavy participants on the trip. You should not be lackadaisical or apathetic. You are to be involved every step of the way. Students are also expected to complete all course-related materials, attend a pre-trip briefing, and write a donor thank you letter. Other expectations can be seen in the expectations section below.

### Am I able to take photos and videos while on the mission trip?
   * The short answer is YES! The CGCS would love for you to take photos and videos while on your trip and send them to the CGCS Communication Specialist. The CGCS may end up posting some of your photos and videos, along with prayer requests while you are on the trip. One thing to keep in mind, you need to follow the guidelines for photography set forth by your professor and the team you are joining. You could be going to a secure location or be in a location that restricts photography. Know the area you are going to before bombarding the location with photographs.

### Why should I go on a mission trip?
   * As believers, we are called to make disciples of all nations. Billions of people around the globe have never had an opportunity to hear the Gospel proclaimed. By going on a mission trip, you will be joining in the proclamation of the Gospel to the nations. Here at Southeastern, we desire for all students to GO, telling all they encounter about the wonderful news of Jesus. Mission trips are a pointed way to be involved with this around the globe! Mission trips are also an opportunity for you to get practice with cross-cultural evangelism. Today, the world is rapidly shifting, making cross-cultural experiences a part of our everyday life. An experience like this may help open your eyes to the needs of those around you!

### Why is there a practicum requirement in my degree?
   * As mentioned above, Southeastern desires for all students to be a part of fulfilling the Great Commission and seeing the nations reached with the Gospel. Southeastern also values ministry preparation and practical application in your degree. A practicum blends academic learning with practical application, allowing you to experience ministry first-hand while still in your degree. This is a valuable part of your program!

### Can I go with my friends?
   * YES! As long as they are SEBTS students. We encourage you to grab a group of your friends and jump on a mission trip together! This is a great way to build community and encourage others to take the Gospel to the nations!

### Does a participant have to be a SEBTS student to go?
   * To go on a SEBTS mission trip, a participant has to be a SEBTS student. There is no way around this requirement.

## Financial Questions

---

### Do I have to pay for both the mission trip cost and class tuition?
   * No! You are required to pay the cost of the trip. Tuition for all mission trips run through the CGCS is waived.

### Are there scholarships for mission trips?
   * Yes and no. All mission trips are scholar-shipped in that we subsidize a large chunk of the cost for each student on every trip. There is additional funding available for minority students who apply and are accepted into the Kingdom Diversity Missions Initiative program. For more information, click here.

### How do I or donors make payments for mission trips?
   * Payments for mission trips can be made in multiple ways. Checks can be written out to SEBTS and brought by the CGCS, or you can go online to pay by **[clicking here](https://www.thecgcs.org/donate-pay/)**.

### What does the cost of the trip cover?
   * The cost of the trip covers travel, housing, and food.

### What if I have to back out of a trip? Will the money I've paid and raised be refunded to me?
   * Students are responsible for all money paid on their behalf for mission trips. No donated funds can be refunded to students under any circumstance. Students may only be refunded the money they have paid themselves with approval from the Director of the CGCS.

### What if I raise over what I need?
   * If a student raises more support than is due for their trip, the amount that has been over-raised is dispersed to students in need of trip funding.

### How much does a mission trip normally cost?
   * North American trips typically cost **insert cost here**. International trips typically cost **insert cost here**.

### How much money should I bring with me on the trip?
   * You should not have to bring a lot of money with you on the trip since the travel, housing, and food costs are covered. If you want to buy souvenirs, you will have to provide your funding. Some countries accept the American dollar, while many countries are converting to cashless payment methods. Bringing a credit/debit card with you is probably sufficient for most cases.

### Do I need to get a debit/credit card that works overseas?
   * Many debit/credit cards have ATM/Overseas fees that can cost you a lot of money. It is not necessary to have a travel credit or debit card that works overseas since you will not be paying for the trip out of your pocket, but it could be nice to look into a card with no ATM fees for later travel.
