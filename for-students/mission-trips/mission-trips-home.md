Welcome to the Student Mission Trip home page! This space is a repository for our documentation and manuals for mission trips provided through the [Center for Great Commission Studies](https://thecgcs.org){:target="_blank"}. This space is specifically for students! There is a lot of information and many frequently asked questions, so we wanted to provide a place online where students can get the information they need!

This will not be the place where we advertise or promote new mission trips. You can find that information on [the main website](https://thecgcs.org/trips){:target="_blank"}.

If you would like to contact us directly, feel free to do so at [our main website](https://thecgcs.org/contact/){:target="_blank"}.
