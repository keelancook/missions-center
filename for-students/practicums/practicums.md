Many of the degrees at Southeastern require students to participate in an extended missions practicum. Our desire is to provide infromation for frequently asked questions and a list of available opportunites for students in need of a missions practicum.

Feel free to check back on this page at a later date. If you would like to contact us directly, feel free to do so at [our main website](https://thecgcs.org).
